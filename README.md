============

This is a library of perl modules intended to simplify the process of creating
perl-based web applications. It should be noted that this is not the most
comprehensive, advanced, or even efficient framework for developing perl web
applications - many other disparate modules exist and can be used together for
the same ends. However, the modules provided here emphasise simplicity of use,
flexibility, and clarity, and allow the construction of fairly powerful
applications for relatively little effort.
