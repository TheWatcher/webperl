============

This is a library of perl modules intended to simplify the process of creating
perl-based web applications. It should be noted that this is neither the most
comprehensive, advanced, or even efficient framework for developing perl web
applications - many other disparate modules exist and can be used together for
the same ends. However, the modules provided here emphasise simplicity of use,
flexibility, and clarity, and allow the construction of fairly powerful
applications for relatively little effort.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation for this library can be generated using Doxygen v1.8 or
later (v1.7 will not handle the Markdown content correctly). In order to
process the perl files correctly, you must install the Doxygen Perl Filter,
see:

* <http://sourceforge.net/projects/perldoxygen/files/>
* <http://www.bigsister.ch/doxygenfilter/documentation.html>

Once you have Doxygen and Doxygen Perl Filter installed, run the 'makedocs.sh'
script in the main directory to generate the documentation.
